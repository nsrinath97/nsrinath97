## Projects

#### Azure Multiple Scenarios Project [Link](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1IjPF3YBlqaPKjxKieFvmPLSw9RDrPH3u/view?usp=sharing)
##### Three separate scenarios that Microsoft Azure tools can provide solutions for

* Scenario 1: Real time data streaming analytics - Stream the events of a hockey game and query the results
* Scenario 2: Near real time streaming data analytics - Log analytics for network monitoring
* Scenario 3: Batch processing for large structured data - Processing of a customer transactions table

#### Azure Medallion Architecture Project [Link](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1bHgO5YEtkDzXca3bsNDmc6u_Zw8uomet/view?usp=drive_link)

* Create sample customers and transactions dataset to manipulate raw data into medallion architecture
* Use Azure Synapse Analytics to create SQL tables for Bronze, Silver and Gold level tables and populate them with data
* Create dashboards and reports using Microsoft PowerBI connected to the Synapse workspace

#### Airplane Delay Prediction Machine Learning Project: [Link](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1vcy1104NuFZcHYNliuCf_F5OahvDO1WZ/view?usp=sharing)

* Used a data set of over 1.7 million rows and 31 columns to train ML models to predict airplane delay
* Web scraped for over 90 thousand rows of data for feature engineering to improve model performance
* Trained 8 ML models and tuned hyper parameters to improve model performance and reduce over fitting

#### Fashion Images Auto-encoding and Image Classification Machine Learning Project: [Link](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1owVZbfaW7mur9TY-eAAOsHKaGC8Ed7tf/view?usp=sharing)

* Used data set of 70,000 images to train auto-encoding, image classification machine learning models
* Created and trained a deep convolutional neural network using the Keras library in Tensorflow
* Achieved loss of 0.26 in auto-encoding and an accuracy of 91% in the image classification test sets

#### Used Car Price Prediction Machine Learning Project: [Link](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1tszuZ3mxuK1W3LqzXNsS0auZN4AATfHB/view?usp=sharing)

* Used a data set of 426,880 rows and 25 columns to train machine learning models to used car prices
* Performed Exploratory Data Analysis and extracted 4 features from data set to improve machine learning performance
* Trained 8 machine learning models and saw up to 575% improvement in accuracy over simple Mean Value mode

#### San Fransisco Jobs Exploratory Data Analysis: [Link](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1wuhSbhy8nFMbIZo2WxbCgi4WzD02IBxc/view?usp=sharing)

* Prepare, clean and analyze data set of San Fransisco payroll with over 300,000 data entries and 10 columns using Pandas
* Created visualizations such as histograms, scatter plots and bar charts etc. using Plotly, to answer questions about the data set.
* ained insight on salary trends in San Fransisco per year, most common jobs and variances in salaries based on multiple factors

#### Reddit Web Scraping Project: [Link](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1g7UqlEL_G9zhiQQFYjvtzyJED-V23lBj/view?usp=drive_link)

* Fetched multiple webpages and parsed the data using the requests and Beautiful Soup libraries and displayed the data in a readable format with the Pandas library
* Shows the most liked content, along with the optimal time of day and week to post for maximum viewer engagement
* Obtained data of the top 100 posts on a subreddit from Reddit.com (Title, Username, Date of submission, Number of comments, Link to webpage) and converted the data into a .csv file with 100 rows and 6 columns
